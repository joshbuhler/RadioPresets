# Hyper Memory Setup
The FT-8800R has six hyper-memory buttons that can store different configurations for the radio, including frequencies and scanning modes. I'm using these to quickly swap between different standard setups. I can't save these in a file that can be restored, so I had to manually set these up on the radio.

## Hyper 1
This sets the radio scanning all memory presets, with the exception of the weather stations. Both sides of the radio are actively scanning, but in opposite directions. Left side scanning up, right side scanning down.

## Hyper 2
Basically my favorites list for the Salt Lake area. The left side is monitoring the Farnsworth Peak repeater, 146.62, while the right side scans a list of the following stations:

* 2M calling
* 70cm calling
* Lake Mountain, 146.76
* Intertie, Farnsworth link
* Sinbad, Lake Mountain link

## Hyper 3
The left side is monitoring the Farnsworth Peak repeater, 146.62, while the right is Lake Mountain, 146.76

## Hyper 4
Left is 2M calling, right is scanning weather stations

## Hyper 5
This changes a lot. Currently can't remember what I have it doing.

## Hyper 6
This setup changes frequently, usually setup for whatever trip I'm currently on. Left is the simplex frequency the group I'm with is currently using, while the right is scanning a list of nearby repeaters, with the addition of the 2M & 70cm calling freqs.
