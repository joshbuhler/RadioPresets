# Yaesu FT-60R Details

Some notes on how I've configured my FT-60R. Basically uses the same setup as the FT-8800R for consistency.


## Memory Banks

Presets are grouped into various related memory banks.

### Bank 1
Presets 1-10. Common frequencies I use. Mostly simplex stuff and repeaters close to home.

### Bank 2
Presets 20-41. Repeaters that belong to the Intermountain Intertie system.

### Bank 3
Presets 45-61. Sinbad repeater system.

### Bank 4
Presets 420-456. Air traffic frequencies, mostly SLC airport, with Ogden, Hill AFB, and generic frequencies. The stuff that gets high.

### Bank 5
Presets 475-496. FRS / GMRS channels.

### Bank 10
Slots 70-79. NOAA weather radio stations. While the FT-60R has built-in presets for the weather stations, I've just left them here for consistency. I always seem to forget how to access them, but it's easy to remember that I have them save on bank 10, starting at preset #70.
