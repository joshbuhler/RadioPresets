# RadioPresets
Just a backup of the presets I use on my amateur radio gear. Mostly for my own use, but if anyone wants to use it as well, go nuts.

I have two radios at the moment, a Yaesu FT-8800R, and a Baofeng UV-5R. For simplicity, I have the same basic config on both radios, with appropriate changes based on what features the radio supports.

These presets are based on me living in the Salt Lake Valley, and most of my travel being around Utah. So, if you’re outside Utah, this likely isn’t going to be of much use to you.

# About the Files
There is a folder for each radio’s preset info. The files included are:

* A [CHIRP](http://chirp.danplanet.com/) image file
* A CSV copy of the preset info
* A reference file of some sort that I use to print out a paper copy of the presets.
